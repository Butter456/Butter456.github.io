**Lesson 2**

**Learning some python on Codecademy**

For any of you who may not know, Python is a coding language language that we will be learning in Year 8.To me it seems a bit easier than html as on python, you can make notes on your code that doesn't appear in your final product (reminders of what the code is and what it means so every time you go back to it, it gives you a reminder of what you did and what it is actually is). I got up to page 8 on the "Learning Python" activity.
