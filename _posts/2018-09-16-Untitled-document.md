**Lesson 1**

**Setting up a new Github Repository**

In this lesson we set up a new Github repository to make a new website by forking the 'Barry Clark Jekyll' website maker. Leaving the lesson, I was thinking about 5 things that I could do to change what I did last year to my blog, like "Why donâ€™t I try to change my mindset on this project rather than just giving up when this get tough?" When I was completing it I changed the background image, background position, background attachment, background repeat, font family, weight of font and the font colour.
